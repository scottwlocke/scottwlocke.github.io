## General informations

This theme is a mix between [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) and the original [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) considering both have features I like and lack others, I've decided to roll up my sleeve and tweak it a bit, the biggest change is most likely a dependency on fontawesome kits. 

You can see it in action here: https://4s3ti.net

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/4s3ti/hugo-theme-hello-4s3ti.git](https://github.com/4s3ti/hugo-theme-hello-4s3ti.git) and pasting it to `themes/hello-4s3ti` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4s3ti/hugo-theme-hello-4s3ti.git themes/hello-4s3ti
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

``` bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/4s3ti/hugo-theme-hello-4s3ti.git themes/hello-4s3ti
```

## How to configure


The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy the following config file.
To see all possible configurations, [check the docs](docs/config.md).

Note: There are more options to configure. Take a look into the `config.toml` and `config.yaml` in [exampleSite](./exampleSite/) directory.

``` toml
baseurl      = "localhost"

  dateformNum     = "2006-01-02"
  dateformNumTime = "2006-01-02 15:04"

  # Subtitle for home
  homeSubtitle = "A simple and beautiful blog"

  # Set disableReadOtherPosts to true in order to hide the links to other posts.
  disableReadOtherPosts = false

  # Enable sharing buttons, if you like
  enableSharingButtons = true

    # or
    #

## More things

### Built-in shortcodes

Of course you are able to use all default shortcodes from hugo (https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

#### image

Properties:

  - `src` (required)
  - `alt` (optional)
  - `position` (optional, default: `left`, options: [`left`, `center`, `right`])
  - `style`

Example:

``` golang
{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
```

### Code highlighting

By default the theme is using PrismJS to color your code syntax. All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

<pre>
``` html
  // your code here
```
</pre>

### Favicon

Check the [docs](docs/favicons.md).

### Audio Support

You wrote an article and recorded it? Or do you have a special music that you would like to put on a certain article? Then you can do this now without further ado.

In your article add to your front matters part:

```yaml
audio: path/to/file.mp3
```

## Social Icons:

### FontAweome

To use the Social Media icons and the Share Icons you are required to have at least a free [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) Icon Kit   

* Go to [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* Create an account
* Go to kits, create new kit
* Add the Kit Link to your config


A large variety of social icons are available and can be configured like this:

```toml
[[params.social]]
  name = "<site>"
  url = "<profile_URL>"
```
If the icon is not available or you wish to use another icon, you can also override the icon by specifying the Icon value.

```toml
[[params.social]]
  name = "<site>"
  url = "<profile_URL>"
  icon = "<Icon>"
```
### Hide Title and Language on single pages


```toml
+++
Title = "Ferramentas"
hideTitle = true
hidelanguage = true
+++
```

## How to edit the theme

Just edit it. You don't need any node stuff. ;)
