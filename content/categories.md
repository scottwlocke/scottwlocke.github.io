To create categories and posts with devise, you need to follow some steps:

Create a content/categories folder in your Hugo site directory
Create a _index.md file inside that folder with some front matter like title, description and layout
Create subfolders for each category you want to have, such as content/categories/tech, content/categories/lifestyle, etc.
Create another _index.md file inside each subfolder with some front matter like title, description and layout
Create your posts inside each subfolder with some front matter like title, date, author and categories
